## **What is Fixify**

- Fixify is the first platform that TRULY focuses on the connection between Developers and User.

- It tells the User what is being dealt with and what is being worked on

- It Allows users to come to a "democratic" consensus on what is most urgent/fun/cool feature/bug/fix that’s needs to be added/changed about the app/game

- Fixify is a tool that benefits both the Users and the Developers

- Before, with 10 different platforms on feed back, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, other social media apps, DMs that never gets opened, Emails that never get responded to,

- Fixify is a centralized platform for all feedback and User Ideas to be communicated with the Devs.

## **Why Fixify**

### **Devs:**

After years developing an App or game, finally getting those last few features to work, you finally release it.

Right away, you realize that there are bugs and glitches that effect the User experience.

So you set up a discord server, a subreddit, an instagram page, a dev contact email
Trying to get all the different inputs from all users

All this info, there is no group consensus or discussion that is centralized and reviewed by the community that uses your application

It is incredibly difficult to know where to start working and further improving your application

There is no streamlined location where User ideas come to place

You are swamped and users leave through the lack of update that interests them

### **Users:**

A new app just came out and you think it helps you plenty

However, soon you see some flaws and bugs that is affecting your experience.

You try to find the help/contact page

In the sub menu, you see multiple options of multiple ways of contacting

Phones: inconsistent and rarely picked up or on hold for hours
Emails: never response, or takes months or weeks
Discord: Servers with thousands of people and suggestions that are blended in to one, what ever suggestion you have will be buried under the constant messages and spams
Reddit: Your Idea may get some traction… FROM USERS, will never know if Developers is really looking at Reddit, specifically user discussion
Others: Just… no

You are getting more and more frustrated by trying to get the attention of the staffs/devs

It seems like they are not even focusing on the User's experience

You are iritated and the app becomes less interesting
